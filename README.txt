This is a template containing a build setup for Binary Ninja themes which
leverage custom stylesheets, preprocessed with Sass [1].

This is for my personal use; support and/or maintenance should not be expected,
but this repo is public as there is no reason to keep it private.

See the Makefile for more details.
